Inspiring by compressive sensing framework we developed CS-JPEG video codec which follows Distributive Video Coding (DVC) concept where an input frame is encoded separately (intra encoding), while the decoding is performed for a group of frames (inter-frame decoding). Current results obtained on 27 CIF test video sequences shows that:
1. CS-JPEG encoder is 2.2, 1.9, and 30.5 times **faster** than JPEG, x264-intra (ultrafast) and x265 (ultrafast), respectively, in assumption that all the codecs were run without any software optimization tools, such as assembler optimization or threads.
2. CS-JPEG achieves **improvements in Î”PSNR** by 2.21, 0.74 and 1.40 dB compares to JPEG, x264-intra (ultrafast) and x265 (ultrafast), respectively.
3. CS-JPEG provides a high level of quality **scalability**.
